# Hi, I'm Sagnick
This repository allows me to host my [personal website](https://sagnibak.github.io) using GitHub Pages. You probably want to see that website
instead of trying to parse the raw markdown and HTML here using your brain.

## Credits
I am using the [Beautiful Jekyll](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) theme made by [Dean Attali](https://deanattali.com/).

This template was not made entirely from scratch. I would like to give special thanks to:
- [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark) and his project [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), from whom I've taken several ideas and code snippets, as well as some documenation tips.
- [Iron Summit Media](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia) and their project [Bootstrap Clean Blog](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-clean-blog), from which I've used some design ideas and some of the templating code for posts and pagination.

I'd also like to thank [Dr. Jekyll's Themes](https://drjekyllthemes.github.io/), [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/), and another [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllrc.github.io/jekyllthemes/) for featuring Beautiful Jekyll in their Jekyll theme directories.
