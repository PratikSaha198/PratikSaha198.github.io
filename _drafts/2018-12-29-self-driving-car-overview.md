Over the next couple of months, I want to make a self-driving car. Okay, I know that sounds really fancy,
and honestly even I am not sure ~~how much of a success~~ how big a failure it will be, but there's no harm
in trying, and it will be a _learning experience_ either way. I have decided to share this journey with the
world through my personal blog so keep following me over the next couple months to see how far I can go. And
if you have any suggestions to help me along the way, I'm all-ears! I am doing taking up this challenge with
the goal of learning, after all. (Learning what, you ask? I will be able to tell you only after I am done
with this project.)

Turns out, programming a self-driving car is not as difficult as all the big companies make it seem:

In all seriousness though, we need to have a solid plan about how we are actually going to make the self-driving
car. First, let's clearly define the scope of this project; after all, people have wildly different ideas about
what constitutes a self-driving car.

## Goal

The ultimate goal of this project is to build a self-driving RC car (1/10<sup>th</sup> scale) that will be able to compete in
the [DIY Robocars](https://diyrobocars.com/) [Oakland races](https://diyrobocars.com/diy-robocar-races-110th-and-116th/).
You can check out the links for more information, but here is a summary: about once every 2 months or so a bunch
of smart people who've made their own self-driving RC cars meet up in a warehouse in Oakland and race their
creations. Since I happen to live only about 12 miles from there, I have no reason not to go there.

So I will call this project a success only when **I successfully make a self-driving car that is
able to meaningfully compete in one of those races.**

## How to get there

Now that we have a clear picture of what I want to do, let's break this problem down into simple, tangible parts
that can be coded or built.

### Hardware

As a simplification, I have decided not to worry too much about hardware until the software is ready. The only
thing I can say with certainty at this point about the hardware is that it will be a 1/10<sup>th</sup> scale
RC car with a single-board computer onboard (a Raspberry Pi or some slightly more powerful board) along with
a camera and an IMU. As for LIDAR, I am not sure whether I will need it or not, and I certainly don't want to
buy a LIDAR sensor right now only to find out later that I don't need it, so I am going to take care of the
software side first.
