My name is Sagnik (साग्निक/সাগ্নিক) Bhattacharya, but I prefer to spell it _Sagnick_.
You can use the pronouns he/him/his when you talk about me in English.
That picture up there really is a picture of me, but from 2012.

Currently I am majoring in Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley. I am very interested in autonomous robots, especially
self-driving cars. To me, they are quite literally math in motion.

I am fluent in English, Hindi, Bangla, French, Python, Scheme, SQL, Java, and BrainF**k. And I have a decent level of proficiency in Urdu,
Sanskrit, Esperanto, C, C++, and Javascript.
