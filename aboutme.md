title: About me
subtitle: Or why you might care about me

My name is Sagnik Bhattacharya, but I prefer to spell it _Sagnick_ because there are way too many Indians who spell their name _Sagnik_.
You can use the pronouns he/him/his when you talk about me.
That picture up there really is a picture of me, but from 2012. If what I look like really matters to you then let me assure you that I
am just as cute now as I was in 2012.

Currently I study Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley, and I will probably do a double major in CS and Statistics
(and probably also a minor in Geography with a focus in Earth System Science). Eventually I want to do a PhD in Computer Science and work
on self-driving cars and other kinds of autonomous robots.

I am fluent in English, Hindi, Bangla, French, Python, Scheme, SQL, Java, and BrainF**k. And I have a decent level of proficiency in Urdu,
Sanskrit, Esperanto, C, C++, and Javascript.
