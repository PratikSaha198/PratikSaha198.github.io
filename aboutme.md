My name is Sagnik (साग्निक/সাগ্নিক) Bhattacharya, but I prefer to spell it _Sagnick_.
You can use the pronouns he/him/his when you talk about me in English.
That picture up there really is a picture of me, but from 2012.

Currently I am double-majoring in Computer Science and Statistics at the
University of California, Berkeley. This semester I am a TA for
[CS 189](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/189/) (Introduction to Machine
Learning) and a Senior [Computer Science Mentor](https://csmentors.berkeley.edu/#/)
for [CS 70](http://www.eecs70.org/) (Discrete Math and Probability Theory).

I am fluent in English, Hindi, Bangla, French, Python, Scheme, SQL, Java, and BrainF**k.
And I have a decent level of proficiency in Urdu, Sanskrit, Esperanto, C, C++, and Javascript.
