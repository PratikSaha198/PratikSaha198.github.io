My name is Sagnik (साग्निक/সাগ্নিক) Bhattacharya, but I prefer to spell it _Sagnick_.
You can use the pronouns he/him/his when you talk about me in English.
That picture up there really is a picture of me, but from 2012. A more recent
photo of me is on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sagnik-bhattacharya-83121b114/).

Currently I am double-majoring in Computer Science and Statistics at the
University of California, Berkeley. I am part of the
[CS Honors Program](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/honors).
I have received the [Dean's Honor](https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/policies/deans-listhonors)
in every semester that it was offered so far (Fall 2018, Spring 2019, Fall 2020).

This semester I am Head TA for
[CS 70](https://www.eecs70.org/) (Discrete Math and Probability Theory).
I manage assignments, oversee grading, and plan the general flow of the course.
I also teach four 1-hour discussion sections each week, and hold office hours.
[This](https://github.com/sagnibak/cs70-su20-disc) GitHub repository
contains notes from my discussion sections.

In Spring 2020, I was a TA for 
[CS 189](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/189/) (Introduction to Machine
Learning) and a Senior [Computer Science Mentor](https://csmentors.berkeley.edu/#/)
for [CS 70](http://www.eecs70.org/) (Discrete Math and Probability Theory).

I went to TreeHacks in February 2020 and built [this](https://ml-visualizer.herokuapp.com/)
web app which visualizes the decision boundaries of different machine learning models on
different datasets. This project won the Best Data Visualization Hack award.

I am fluent in English, Hindi, Bangla, French, Python, Scheme, SQL, Java, and BrainF**k.
And I have a decent level of proficiency in Urdu, Sanskrit, Esperanto, C, C++, and Javascript.
